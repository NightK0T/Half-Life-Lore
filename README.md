# Half-Life Lore Projects

* [City's in Half-Life Universe & Fan Lore](https://github.com/users/NightK0T/projects/1/views/1) - Here are all references to the numbers of "Cities" that are found in the fans lore, including maps, mods and game maps. If the numbers intersect with each other, preference is given to the most important object in the subjective opinion of the author. For example: City-5 in high-quality modification is more important than mentioning the City on someone's world map.
* [Earth map in Half-Life Universe & Fan Lore](https://github.com/users/NightK0T/projects/2/views/1) - List of all found maps of Earth after the 7 Hour War and the Combine occupation.
